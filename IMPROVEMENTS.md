- Added quality filtering options

## Technical Improvements

### Code Organization
- Followed MVC pattern more closely by separating business logic from UI
- Created reusable utility classes for common functionality
- Implemented proper error handling throughout the application
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing

### Memory and Performance
- Improved resource management with proper cleanup

- Added multi-threading for responsive UI during processing
- Created progress reporting to keep users informed during long operations

## Future Work

While significant improvements have been made, several areas for future enhancement include:

1. **Settings Interface** - Create a dedicated settings interface for configuring application preferences
2. **Results Visualization** - Add visualization tools for detection results and statistics
3. **Model Management** - Implement a dedicated interface for managing and updating detection models
4. **Data Export** - Add more export options for detection results
5. **Testing** - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Implementation Details

The improvements were made across multiple files:

- `mfid/utils/config_manager.py` - Configuration management
- `mfid/utils/logging_utils.py` - Logging system
- `mfid/utils/notifications.py` - User notification system
- `mfid/utils/batch.py` - Batch processing framework
- `mfid/app/mfid_app.py` - Main application interface
- `mfid/face/quality_assessment.py` - Face quality assessment
- `mfid/face/face_detector.py` - Improved face detection

These enhancements significantly improve the application's usability, maintainability, and performance while providing a more polished user experience.
